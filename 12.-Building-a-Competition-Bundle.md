Building a competition in CodaLab is possible by uploading a Competition Bundle. A Competition Bundle is a zip archive which contains a yaml file that describes the competition. Other assets are included in the zip archive but won't be used unless they are referenced in the competition.yaml file.

Here is an example [competition.yaml](https://github.com/codalab/codalab/blob/master/codalab/scripts/competition_example/competition.yaml). If you are not familiar with how competitions look in CodaLab, you might browse competitions before you read the configuration to get a basic understanding of the components of a competition.

Here's an annotated competition.yaml, to explain the various configuration elements.

```
