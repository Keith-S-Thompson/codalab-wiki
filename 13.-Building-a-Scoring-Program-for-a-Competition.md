In the current CodaLab competition model a competition is constructed with a set of Reference Data and a Scoring Program. The way competitions work currently the Reference Data is compared with a participants submission and the differences in the two are scored using the Scoring Program.

The program.zip bundle contains the Scoring Program that compares the participants submission with the reference data (in the reference.zip bundle) to score the submission. In this example the reference data contains the value of pi. The program.zip bundle computes the absolute difference of the submitted value from the reference value.

Here are the contents of the reference.zip file:
```
reference.zip 
  |- answer.txt (Contains: 3.14159265359)
  |- metadata   (Contains: This is the authoritative result.)
```

Here are the contents of the program.zip file:
```
program.zip
  |- evaluate.exe (The program that's run)
  |- metadata     (Contents below...)
  |- supporting modules and libraries for evaluate.exe to run in isolation.
```

The program.zip metadata file contains:
```
command: $program/evaluate.exe $input $output
description: Example competition evaluation program.
```

Here are the assumptions about the scoring process and the scoring program:
#) There is a fixed directory structure that the scoring program operates within. It looks like this:
```
Submission Directory
  |- input
    |- ref (This is the reference data unzipped)
    |- res (This is the user submission unzipped)
  |- program (This is the scoring program [and any included dependencies] unzipped)
  |- output
```
