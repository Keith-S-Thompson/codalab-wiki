If you are a developer and want to help build CodaLab, this page will explain how to to get started.

To use use and test the submission process, a queue server will need to be installed. RabbitMQ installs easily on Linux and Windows and requires no configuration out of the box for testing purposes. A database besides SQLite is recommended. MySQL and Postgres work on Windows, Linux and Mac. SQL Server on Windows can be used, but support is not as complete as MySQL and Postgres.

## Local installation

This is all Python. It supports development on local machines with Windows, Linux, Mac and BSD. If something is broken, let us know.

In this section, we will walk you through installing Python 2.7.x, installing a version of pip >= 1.3 (for installing Python packages) and running the CodaLab site in a local virtual environment.

### Unix-based systems

For current Debian-based Linux distributions, BSD and Mac Python 2.7 is usually installed. However... Redhat-based Linux distributions, such as RHEL and CentOS, sometimes behind the curve and do not have Python 2.7. As of this writing, CentOS 6.4 is at Python 2.6, which is well on its way to EOL. Python 2.6 may work, but code will be written with 2.7 and 3.3+ in mind. Below are instructions for a specific flavor of Linux.

#### Ubuntu Linux 13.04+

Assuming a fresh Ubuntu install the following commands should get you started. Environment variables are used to control settings for a flexible build process. The build script will accept an environment variable, CONFIG_MODULE_PATH, to a location of an installable python source package which will get installed and be used as the settings module, which is specifically specified with DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE:

1. Checkout the CodaLab code from GitHub

    `git clone https://github.com/codalab/codalab.git`
    `cd codalab`
    `scripts/dev_bootstrap`
    `CONFIG_REQ=dev_azure_nix.txt DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=codalab.settings DJANGO_CONFIGURATION=Dev scripts/build`

1. If you want rabbitmq-server:
   `sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server`

1.  `cd codalab`

1. `./mange syncdb --migrate`

1. Run tests to veirfy that everything is working:
 
   `./manage.py test`

1. Populate the site:
        
     `source config/generated/startup_env.sh`
     `python scripts/users.py`
     `python scripts/competitions.py`

1. Start the web server:

    `./manage runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

1. Create a local settings override in 'codalab/settings/local.py'. There is an example, 'local_sample.py', in the settings directory.

### Windows (tested on Windows 8)

Assuming a fresh windows environment the following should get you started:

1. Install python 2.7 (the latest for windows) which you can find [here](http://www.python.org/download/releases/). Be sure to select the installer for your architecture. This typically will install to C:\Python27. The rest of these instructions will assume installation in this path.
1. To Install pip you should first install distribute. Download the file at the following URL:
   http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py and run it from a shell from the directory into which it was downloaded:

   `C:\Python27\python.exe distribute_setup.py`

   This will put easy_install.exe in the Scripts directory of your Python installation. Then, you're ready to install pip from a cmd prompt:

   `C:\Python27\Scripts\easy_install.exe pip`

1. Next install [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/)

   `C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install virtualenv`

1. Install git (either of these, or both):
   1. https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
   1. http://windows.github.com/
1. Get the source:

   `git clone https://github.com/codalab/codalab.git`
   `cd codalab`

1. Create a virtual environment and finish the setup:

   `./dev_setup.bat`

   At this point you should be able to run the site locally:

   `python codalab/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

1. You could also verify your setup by running tests from the directory where `manage.py` is located: 

   `python manage.py test`

1. If you start from a clean database, there are ways to programmatically insert data:

        python codalab/scripts/users.py
        python codalab/scripts/competitions.py

When your next coding session comes along, remember to work in the virtual environment you created:

   `venv/scripts/activate.bat`

If you need to bring the model and database in sync:

   `python codalab/manage.py syncdb`

Note: If you experience database errors try deleting the database file (\codalab\codalab\dev_db.*) and run syncdb again.

#### Work with CodaLab in Visual Studio
**Create the codalab project:**

1. In Visual Studio File menu click **New Project**. Under **Templates**, select **Other Languages**, then choose **Python**.
2. Select the **From Existing Python Code** template.
3. Name the project "codalab".
4. **Location** should be root of Git (for example C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\).
5. Uncheck the **Create directory for solution** option.
6. Click OK. The Create New Project from Existing Python Code dialog appears.
7. Enter the path for the root of the project (for example C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\codalab)
8. add *.scss to the filter list.
9. Click **Next**.
10. Select **Python 2.7** from the dropdown menu.
11. Click Finish. The Visual Studio project file and solution files should be located in the root folder for the project: codalab\codalab.pyproj & codalab\codalab.sln.


[The following page](https://github.com/codalab/codalab/wiki/Notes-for-local-setup-on-windows) includes notes which have not been cleaned up but provide good tips for more effective ways to develop on Windows. For example, you can use Visual Studio as your development environment and use the integrated debugger. You can also run against a SQL Server instance and use tools that you may be familiar with (e.g. Microsoft SQL Server Managerment Studio).
