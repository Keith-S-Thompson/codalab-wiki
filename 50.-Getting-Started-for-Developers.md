If you are a developer and want to help build CodaLab, this page will explain how to to get started.

## Local installation

This is all Python. It supports development on local machines with Windows, Linux, Mac and BSD. If something is broken, let us know.

In this section, we will walk you through installing Python 2.7.x, installing a version of pip >= 1.3 (for installing Python packages) and running the CodaLab site in a local virtual environment.

### Unix-based systems

For current Debian-based Linux distributions, BSD and Mac Python 2.7 is usually installed. However... Redhat-based Linux distributions, such as RHEL and CentOS, sometimes behind the curve and do not have Python 2.7. As of this writing, CentOS 6.4 is at Python 2.6, which is well on its way to EOL. Python 2.6 may work, but code will be written with 2.7 and 3.3+ in mind. Below are instructions for a specific flavor of Linux.

#### Ubuntu Linux 13.04+

Assuming a fresh Ubuntu install the following commands should get you started:

1. Upgrade the system

  1. `sudo apt-get update`
    1. enter your password to get admin access
  1. `sudo apt-get upgrade -y`
  1. `sudo apt-get install git python-pip -y`
  1. `sudo pip install virtualenv`

1. Checkout the CodaLab code from GitHub

    `git clone https://github.com/codalab/codalab.git`

1. `cd codalab`

1. `./dev_setup.sh`

1. `source venv/bin/activate`

1. `python codalab/manage.py syncdb`

1. Run tests to veirfy that everything is working: 
    * `python codalab/manage.py test web`

1. Populate the site:

    `python codalab/scripts/users.py`
    `python codalab/scripts/competitions.py`
    `python codalab/scripts/initialize.py`

1. Start the web server:

    `python codalab/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

### Windows (tested on Windows 8)

Assuming a fresh windows environment the following should get you started:

1. Install python 2.7 (the latest for windows) which you can find [here](http://www.python.org/download/releases/). Be sure to select the installer for your architecture. This typically will install to C:\Python27. The rest of these instructions will assume installation in this path.
1. To Install pip you should first install distribute. Download the file at the following URL:
   http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py and run it from a shell from the directory into which it was downloaded:

   `C:\Python27\python.exe distribute_setup.py`

   This will put easy_install.exe in the Scripts directory of your Python installation. Then, you're ready to install pip from a cmd prompt:

   `C:\Python27\Scripts\easy_install.exe pip`

1. Next install [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/)

   `C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install virtualenv`

1. Install git (either of these, or both):
   1. https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
   1. http://windows.github.com/
1. Get the source:

   `git clone https://github.com/codalab/codalab.git`
   `cd codalab`

1. Create a virtual environment and finish the setup:

   `./dev_setup.bat`

   At this point you should be able to run the site locally:

   `python codalab/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

1. You could also verify your setup by running tests: 

   `python codalab manage.py test web`

1. If you start from a clean database, there are ways to programmatically insert data:

   `python codalab/scripts/users.py`

   `python codalab/scripts/competitions.py`

When your next coding session comes along, remember to work in the virtual environment you created:

   `venv/scripts/activate.bat`

If you need to bring the model and database in sync:

   `python codalab/manage.py syncdb`

## Next steps

Now that you're setup you might want to review some of the [conventions and practices](https://github.com/codalab/codalab/wiki/CodaLab-Conventions-for-Developers) of the CodaLab team.
