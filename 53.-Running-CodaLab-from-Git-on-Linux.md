**Assumptions**
* You are on a fresh machine: CodaLab has not been installed or CodaLab has been removed

If that is true these steps should work:
 
1. git clone https://github.com/codalab/codalab.git
2. cd codalab
3. source venv/bin/activate
4. python codalab/manage.py syncdb
5. python codalab/scripts/initialize.py
6. python codalab/scripts/users.py
7. python codalab/scripts/competitions.py
8. python codalab/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Now you should be able to open a browser and type in your DNS URL to access CodaLab.
	In this example it would be http://cl-dev-ubuntu.cloudapp.net/
