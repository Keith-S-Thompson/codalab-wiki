### Editing guidelines

In order to keep this content coherent we have adopted the following page naming convention to make it easy to find things. We are using pseudo-namespaces to organize pages. This is accomplished by using prefixes for the page names, such as "Dev: configuring your setup". This is the current subject area breakdown to make things consistent:

* **Project** - Project Documentation
* **User** - Competition Organizer Documentation
* **UX** - User Experience / Interaction Design Documentation
* **Dev** - Developer Documentation
* **Test** - Test Documentation
* **Release** -  Release Documentation

While codes are convenient for quick classification, it is better if pages are found by naturally following the above content guide.
