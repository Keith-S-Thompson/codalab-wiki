### Editing guidelines

In order to keep this content coherent we have adopted the following page naming convention to make it easy to find things. Every page title is prefixed with a code consisting of two digits followed by a period. The digits represent the subject area of the wiki page. This is the current subject area breakdown to make things consistent:

* 00-09. Project Documentation
* 10-19. User Experience / Interaction Design Documentation
* 20-29. Developer Documentation
* 30-39. Test Documentation
* 40-49. Release Documentation

While codes are convenient for quick classification, it is better if pages are found by naturally following the above content guide.
