This repo is a clone of https://github.com/codalab/codalab.wiki.git,
the wiki for [codalap](https://github.com/codalab/codalab).

The `:` and `'` characters in the file names cause problems for Windows
users, as pointed out in [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/22211995/827263)
on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

This is not intended to be a functional copy of the Wiki (I don't
know whether or how the Wiki depends on the ':' characters in the file
names), nor do I intend to maintain it. I'm just making it available
here so the questioner and others can look at it.
